Learning how to use GitHub and Git to become more proficient in front end web development. Have started to learn html and css and dipped a toe into javascript and jquery. I guess Git and GitHub are also essential for front end web development. I have to admit, understanding the concepts of Git is more challenging than learning html and css. Hopefully not as bad as Jquery.

I'm a successful freelance designer for 27 years hoping to gain new skills in electronic web and email design. I have a thorough knowledge of print design and am working to apply those principles to electronic design as well. Learning to code to implement my website and email designs has long been a goal of mine.
